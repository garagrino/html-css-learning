# 🚀 My HTML & CSS Learning Journey

Welcome to my coding playground! This repository documents my progress as I learn **Frontend Development** from scratch. I push my daily practice code, experiments, and mini-projects here to track my growth over time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure, forms, and tables.
* **CSS3:** Styling, layouts (Flexbox/Grid), and responsive design.
* **Git:** Version control basics.

## 📂 What's Inside?
I organise my learning modules by topic:
* `01-Basics`: Introduction to tags, elements, and attributes.
* `02-Styling`: Colours, fonts, and box model experiments.
* `03-Layouts`: Practice with Flexbox and CSS Grid.
* `04-Projects`: Small builds like landing pages or cards.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run
Since these are static files, you don't need to install anything complex.
## 📈 Current Focus
- [x] Understanding HTML structure.
- [ ] Mastering CSS Flexbox.
- [ ] Building a personal portfolio page.
